                    <h2>Institute History</h2>
                    <p>Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) was established by the Govt. NCT of Delhi in May, 2013 vide Delhi Act 09 of 2012, as a non-affiliating University to facilitate and promote studies, research, technology,
                        innovation, incubation and extension work in emerging areas of professional education among women, with focus on engineering, technology, applied sciences, architecture and its allied areas with the objective to achieve excellence
                        in these and related fields. Erstwhile Indira Gandhi Institute of Technology (IGIT) was established in 1998 by Directorate of Training and Technical Education, Govt. of NCT of Delhi as the first engineering college for women only.
                        In 2002, the college became the first constituent college of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. Over the years erstwhile IGIT has significantly contributed to the growth of quality technical education in the country and

                    <p>It feels great to be the wind beneath the wings of one of the top ranking Emerging Engineering Institutes of Technology in India. The devouring stride of IGDTUW, since its inception in 1998 as IGIT, has been exemplary, culminating
                        in transforming itself into an icon for women empowerment. To be a vibrant part of this illustrious edifice of teaching and learning is certainly a matter of stupendous pride and a new-found privilege for me. IGDTUW has evolved
                        to become a national flagship, research-led university with a mission to foster an environment for excellence in professional education and ensure active participation of women in the field of Engineering, Science, Management and
                        Technology, thereby attempting to strike out a fine balance between world of work and life. The university vows to devise sustainable systems and state-of-the-art infrastructure to enable the Indian women to dawn the role of future
                        leaders, managers, researchers and productive team players in the field of science, technology. The University offers a number of B.Tech, B.Arch, M.Tech and Ph.D programmes in faculty of Engineering and Technology. It also aims
                        at teaching, training and elevating the students to an independent level where they can achieve higher level of excellence and professionalism.</p>
